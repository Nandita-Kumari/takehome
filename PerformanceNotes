Performance Notes (Short Version)

Backend (API) Performance
-----------------------------
1. Pagination: Use cursor-based pagination for efficient data retrieval without overloading the server.
2. Database Indexing: Index fields used for filtering and sorting (e.g., orderId, createdAt) to speed up queries.
3. Avoid N+1 Queries: Use joins or populate to minimize multiple database queries.
4. Caching: Use caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
5. Efficient Sorting: Ensure sorting is done on indexed fields to improve performance.


Frontend Performance
---------------------
1. Lazy Loading: Implement infinite scrolling to load data incrementally.
2. Virtualization: Use libraries like react-virtualized to render only visible items in long lists.
3. Memoization: Avoid unnecessary re-renders using React.memo().
4. Debouncing: Implement debouncing for search or filter inputs to reduce frequent API calls.
